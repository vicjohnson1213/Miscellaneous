# PyWeather

> A silly little script to get the weather at any large enough city.

## Setup

The first thing you'll need to do is go to [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/register) and register for an API key.  Then, in your .bashrc keep it in the `WEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable.  Additionally, you can set the `WEATHER_DEFAULT_CITY` environment variable to set the default city for the weather.

## Usage

```bash
weather [city]
```
